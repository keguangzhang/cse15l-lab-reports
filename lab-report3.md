# Lab Report 3: Searching Commands Options for grep

I chose to do web search on the options on command grep. 
The syntax for grep command is grep <pattern/string> <file>, and this command displays all the lines that contain the given pattern or string.
The command-line options I found were -c, 

**grep -c**\
grep -c command prints the count of lines that matches the given string or pattern.

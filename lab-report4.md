# Lab Report 4

**Step 4: log into ieng6**
For this step, since the command to log into the account was already in my history, I typed `Ctrl-C` and then typed `ssh` to get the whole command with my ieng6 account from the history. I then entered `<enter>`. It directly logged into the ieng6 account without asking for my password because I had generated SSH keys before this.

**Step 5: clone the fork of the repository from Gitnub account**
